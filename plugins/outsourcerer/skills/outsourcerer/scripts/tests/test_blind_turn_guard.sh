# test_blind_turn_guard.sh — the orchestrator must not end its turn blind while live delegated work
# needs a human.
#
# The diagnosed failure: four delegated sessions sat parked on approval prompts for over an hour
# while the orchestrator's turn ended silently. Nothing was broken — the orchestrator simply walked
# away without checking, and the user found it by accident. The blind-turn guard fires at the exact
# moment of walking away and refuses to end blind. This test proves:
#   - a delegate ALIVE but BLOCKED awaiting input is reported as "WAITING ON YOU", DISTINCTLY from
#     a delegate that is genuinely working (silence — never block a healthy fleet), and DISTINCTLY
#     from a delegate that is stalled ("MAYBE STUCK").
#   - silence when everything is working, silence when only terminal work exists, silence when there
#     is no fleet view yet, and silence under the OSRC_BLIND_TURN_GUARD=0 escape hatch.
#   - the guard is a single bounded pass (no per-session subprocess fan-out).
