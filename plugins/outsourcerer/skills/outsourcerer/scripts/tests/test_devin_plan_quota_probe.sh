# test_devin_plan_quota_probe.sh — PROBE-THEN-DECIDE for a Devin plan-quota refusal (fixes the 0.12.3
# over-block). A daily/weekly-quota refusal from ONE model must not, on its own, take the whole dv lane
# down or forbid retrying the free models: _devin_plan_quota_block now sends ONE bounded request to a
# sibling free model (_lane_free_probe) and decides from the answer. Pins: (a) the probe primitive's
# three verdicts (answered / limit-refused / unreachable), its wall-clock bound, and the no-recipe rc;
# (b) a fake devin that refuses model X but ANSWERS the free probe -> lane NOT down, the free model is
# named as usable, a stale down marker is cleared; (c) the probe never re-asks the model that was just
# refused; (d) a fake devin that refuses the probe too -> lane DOWN for Devin's stated window with the
# recorded reason; (e) an unreachable probe -> only the short transport window, never the quota window;
# (f) the "do NOT retry them" wording is gone from every user-facing line.
