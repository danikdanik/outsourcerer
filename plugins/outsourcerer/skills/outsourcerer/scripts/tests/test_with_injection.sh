# `--with skills=<name>` resolved ONLY ~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md. Every skill that ships inside a
# PLUGIN (the entire ce-* family) lives in a versioned plugin cache instead, so it silently resolved to
# "NOT FOUND", the note went into the PROMPT where only the delegate could read it, and the caller went on
# believing the delegate had the skill. Delegations ran for a whole session without the capability they
# were briefed to use, and nothing anywhere said so. Today a missing skill FAILS the dispatch outright.
#
# The second half is size. A SKILL.md can be ~100KB. Pasting several verbatim buys latency and spend on
# every delegation, and on a lane that prints nothing until it finishes, a bloated prompt is
# indistinguishable from a hang.
