# and nobody notices it wedged until the user asks. Documentation did not fix it, because "remember to
# watch" is exactly the kind of instruction a busy session drops. So the tool tracks attention itself:
# it demands a watcher at launch, and any later invocation reports jobs nobody has looked at.
