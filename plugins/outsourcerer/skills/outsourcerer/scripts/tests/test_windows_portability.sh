# Defect A: `mkdir -m 700 DIR` creates the directory and then exits NON-ZERO there, because
# applying the mode fails. Every caller that reads that exit status concludes the directory
# was not created. In the background launcher that meant the atomic job-dir claim looked like
# a collision on every attempt: it retried until it gave up, left an empty directory behind
# per attempt, and reported that no job id could be allocated. The effect is that every
# backgrounded or fanned-out delegation is non-functional on that platform, including plain
# runs that auto-detach.
#
# Defect B: `doctor` declared a variable inside a jq-guarded branch and read it unguarded.
# Under `set -u` that aborts the whole command when jq is absent, so the one command whose
# job is to report a missing dependency dies before it can report it.
#
# The MSYS behaviour is simulated with a mkdir stub rather than described, so these assertions
# fail on a POSIX box when the defect is present.
