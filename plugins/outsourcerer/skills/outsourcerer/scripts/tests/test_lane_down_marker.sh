# test_lane_down_marker.sh — the LANE-DOWN posture marker primitives (_lane_down_mark /

# TTL, keyed by LANE (not model), expired markers self-purge value-matched. These primitives are
# inert until a dispatch gate consults them (see the PR's wiring proposal) — this test pins the
# primitive contract so the wiring can be reviewed/added safely.
