# Two causes, one root — a stale assumption written into a comment ("neither agy nor gemini-cli
# exposes a reasoning-effort knob") that stopped being true:
#   1. --effort was never passed, so agy received an empty one and refused the run outright.
#   2. The accepted levels are PER MODEL: pro takes low|high with no medium, flash takes low|medium|high.
# And the lane was listed as ready because the binary printed a version, while every real request
# timed out — which is how work gets routed somewhere that cannot serve it.
